			<h3>My background</h3>
			<p>I've graduated Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (a unique and terribly old university in Kyiv, Ukraine) with a Masters in Social Work (Social Policy and Administration).</p>
			<p>Because I happened to have been learning English all my conscious life, at some point, I preferred becoming a content writer with a tech company to working in my field of study.</p>
			<p>Fast-forward 5 years, and I landed in Berlin. I continued doing what I did in Ukraine. For some time. Until I started craving for a relaunch.</p>
			<p>Now I'm learning to mark up, style, and code web pages. I'm also part of the FrauenLoop 2020 cohort (the first one of this decade!)</p>
